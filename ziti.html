    <p>
      This baked ziti is always a hit! A lady I worked with brought this in one
      day, and everyone loved it. Now it is the favorite of all my dinner
      guests. I have made this also without the meat, and it is well received.

      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>2 (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce</li>
      <li>6 ounces provolone cheese, sliced</li>

    <ol class="recipe-list">
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and
        cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, brown ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium
        heat; stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch
        baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread 1/2 of the ziti in the bottom of the prepared dish; top with
        Provolone cheese, sour cream, 1/2 of the meat sauce, remaining ziti,
        mozzarella cheese, and remaining meat sauce. Top with grated Parmesan
        cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheeses have melted,
        about 30 minutes.

# odin-recipes

This is the Odin Recipes project, a simple HTML-based collection of recipes. These recipes are presented with clear instructions and visuals.

In this project, I've demonstrated skills in HTML markup, image integration, linking, and structuring content. The use of lists and headings ensures a logical presentation of ingredients and steps.

This project allowed me to practice fundamental HTML skills, creating a web project. As I move forward, I plan to enhance the project with CSS for styling.
